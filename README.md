### ATMOSPHERIC WEATHER CARD

I started this because I wanted a weather card that looked nice, but I ended up building a physics engine. The code generates the clouds and rain so they move naturally and never repeat. It also adds random details based on the current weather like wind-blown leaves, planes, birds and shooting stars to make the dashboard feel alive. And if you're lucky, you might even see the rare aurora borealis.

> **AI Disclaimer** — This card was created with the help of AI tools. I would never have the patience to create those weather effects myself.

### USAGE MODES

The card has two modes that affect how it renders and what kind of dashboard setup it expects.

<br>

### Standalone Mode

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00be4670-d259-4690-92ba-e440e71244ef" />

A self-contained card with its own weather-aware background gradients. The card renders the current temperature and bottom detail pulled from your entities (defaults to Wind Speed). The text automatically positions itself on the opposite side of the sun/moon to avoid overlap.

<details>
<summary><b>Example 1 — Basic Card</b></summary>

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
card_style: standalone
card_height: 110
sun_moon_x_position: -55
sun_moon_y_position: 55
sun_entity: sun.sun
tap_action:
  action: more-info
  entity: weather.forecast_home
```

> **Tip** — By default, the bottom text displays **Wind Speed**. You can change this to show any sensor (like `sensor.humidity` or your address) using the `bottom_text_sensor` option. The temperature is formatted automatically based on your Home Assistant language setting (e.g. `4.5` in English, `4,5` in German).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2 — Grid Layout</b></summary>
<br>

| Grid |

You can use a taller card height to fit the card into a grid or horizontal stack alongside other cards. This example pairs the weather card with a graph and a tile card.

```yaml
type: grid
columns: 2
cards:
  - type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
    weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
    card_style: standalone
    card_height: 200
    sun_moon_x_position: -30
    sun_moon_y_position: 30
    sun_entity: sun.sun
    tap_action:
      action: more-info
      entity: weather.forecast_home
  - type: vertical-stack
    cards:
      - type: sensor
        graph: line
        entity: sensor.temperature_indoor
        detail: 1
        name: Indoor Temp
      - type: tile
        entity: sensor.climate_sensor
        name: Air Quality
        icon: mdi:leaf
        state_content: state

This layout gives the weather effects space to breathe. You can combine it with any other card and layer both cards with the `offset` feature.

```yaml
# 1. The Content Card (Foreground)
type: markdown
content: |
  <br>
  ⛅ Enjoy the weather!
  # {{states('sensor.time') }}

# 2. The Weather Card (Background Layer)
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
full_width: true
card_height: 240
# Pulls the card up 120px to sit behind the Markdown card
offset: "-120px 0px 0px 0px"
sun_moon_x_position: -100
sun_moon_y_position: 100
sun_entity: sun.sun
moon_phase_entity: sensor.moon_phase
tap_action:
  action: none
```

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Tip: Faster Initial Load Times</b></summary>

If your dashboard loads slowly, try using the `paper-buttons-row` custom card from HACS instead of standard Home Assistant cards. For some reason it loads significantly faster.

**Example configuration for a simple header:**
```yaml
type: custom:paper-buttons-row
styles:
  margin: 0px 0px -80px 0px  # Use negative margin here instead of on weather card (faster)
  justify-content: flex-start
base_config:
  layout: name
  styles:
    button:
      padding: 0px
    name:
      font-size: 26px
      padding: 0px
      font-weight: 700
buttons:
  - name: Sternschnuppe ✨
```

This setup shows how I use this card. It uses it as a dynamic backdrop for the entire top section of the view, combining it with a custom image and overlay buttons. The card provides the animated weather and image; the buttons shown in the screenshots are separate elements layered on top. [See Adding Buttons](#adding-buttons) and [Custom House Image](#custom-house-image) for details.

</details>


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Immersive mode needs to match your dashboard theme to work correctly.** If you use a fixed theme (like dark mode all day), the card will still switch between light and dark based on the sun. This mismatch makes weather effects look broken. To fix this: use `theme_entity` if your theme automatically switches between light and dark, or use `mode: dark` or `mode: light` to force the card to match your fixed theme. See [Day / Night Logic](#day--night-logic) for details.

### CONFIGURATION REFERENCE

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`weather_entity`** | string | **Required** | Your weather integration entity (e.g. `weather.forecast_home`). |
| **`sun_entity`** | string | **Recommended** | The sun entity (e.g. `sun.sun`) used to automatically calculate day/night cycles. **One of `sun_entity`, `theme_entity`, or `mode` is required.** |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Day/Night Logic is Required**
> In addition to the `weather_entity`, the card needs to know if it is day or night to render the correct lighting. You must configure a method for this (e.g., `sun_entity`).
>
> [See how to configure Day / Night Logic here](#day--night-logic)


<details>
<summary><strong>Layout & Appearance</strong></summary>

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tap_action` | `object` | — | Standard HA action config. Example: `{ action: more-info, entity: weather.forecast }` |

</details>

> **Tip** — The sun and moon share a single position. During the day the sun is drawn there (only in fair weather like sunny, partly cloudy, exceptional); at night the moon takes its place. In standalone mode, the text automatically moves to the opposite side.

<br>

---

### DAY / NIGHT LOGIC

The card determines whether to render a day or night scene using a 4-level priority chain. It checks each level in order and uses the first match.

| Priority | Source | Config Option | Logic |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Manual override | `mode` | `dark`/`night` forces night. `light`/`day` forces day. |
| **2** | Theme entity | `theme_entity` | Matches the entity state against night keywords (`dark`, `night`, `evening`, `on`, `true`, `below_horizon`). |
| **3** | Sun entity | `sun_entity` | Checks if `sun.sun` is `below_horizon`. |
| **4** | System dark mode | — | Falls back to the Home Assistant dark mode toggle in the sidebar. |

> [!NOTE]
> For the "Standalone Mode", `sun_entity: sun.sun` is all you need. The `theme_entity` option is useful if you use the "Immersive Mode" with a dark/light theme that you want the card to follow instead of the sun. The `mode` option is meant for using "Immersive Mode" with a fixed theme (permanent dark or light dashboard background).

<br>

---

### CUSTOM HOUSE IMAGE

To get the immersive look with your own home:

1. **Take a reference photo** from a corner angle to capture depth.
2. **Generate a 3D model image** using an AI image tool with a prompt like:
   > Isometric view of a modern minimalist architectural model section from the outside on solid white background. [Describe your floors/rooms]. Materials are matte white and light wood only. No complex textures, studio lighting, very clean, simplified shapes.
3. **Remove the background** and save as a transparent PNG.
4. **Create day and night variants** with adjusted lighting/colors.
5. **Upload** to `config/www/images/` and reference as `/local/images/my-house-day.png`.

<br>

---

### SMART STATUS ENTITY

The status feature swaps the displayed image when an entity becomes active. Some examples:

| Use case | Example entity | Triggers on |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Door / Window | `binary_sensor.front_door` | `open` |
| Lock | `lock.front_door` | `unlocked` |
| Toggle | `input_boolean.party_mode` | `on` |
| Presence | `zone.home` | `active` |

When the entity returns to an inactive state, the card switches back to the default image.

<br>

---

### ADDING BUTTONS

The floating buttons in the dashboard screenshots are built with `custom:paper-buttons-row` placed before the weather card. Use the `offset` option on this card to layer them visually. A reference config is included in `paper-buttons-row-example.yml`.

<br>

---

### SUPPORTED WEATHER STATES

`sunny` · `clear-night` · `partlycloudy` · `cloudy` · `fog` · `rainy` · `pouring` · `snowy` · `snowy-rainy` · `hail` · `lightning` · `lightning-rainy` · `windy` · `windy-variant` · `exceptional`

Each state sets a unique combination of particle type, count, cloud density, wind speed, and atmosphere. Beyond the core weather, the sky is populated with ambient elements that appear on their own — drifting fog banks, wind-blown leaves, sun rays with heat shimmer, lightning bolts, airplanes, birds in formation, shooting stars, comets, and the rare Aurora Borealis at night. The card also reads `wind_speed` from your weather entity to influence particle behavior in real time.

<br>

---

### Performance

Rendering of the weather animations is handled entirely by the client browser using HTML5 Canvas. Server impact is limited to standard state updates.

* **Resource Management**
  Target framerate is capped at 30 FPS and resolution at 2x DPR to limit GPU usage on the client device.
* **Visibility Control**
  The animation loop stops completely when the card is not visible or the tab is backgrounded.
* **Responsive**
  Native support for Section-based dashboards with debounced resizing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Hardware Requirement:** This card relies on GPU Hardware Acceleration. If high CPU usage is observed, verify that hardware acceleration is enabled in the browser or kiosk settings. Software-only rendering will significantly degrade performance.
