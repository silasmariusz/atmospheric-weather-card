### ATMOSPHERIC WEATHER CARD

I started this because I wanted a weather card that looked nice, but I ended up building a physics engine. The code generates the clouds and rain so they move naturally and never repeat. It also adds random details based on the current weather like wind-blown leaves, planes, birds and shooting stars to make the dashboard feel alive. And if you're lucky, you might even see the rare aurora borealis.

> **AI Disclaimer** — This card was created with the help of AI tools. I would never have the patience to create those weather effects myself.

### USAGE MODES

The card has two modes that affect how it renders and what kind of dashboard setup it expects.

<br>

### Standalone Mode

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d6d662b-72c8-4383-850a-2ab64bb3b690" />

A self-contained card with its own weather-aware background gradients. The card renders the current temperature pulled from your weather entity and the text automatically positions itself on the opposite side of the sun/moon to avoid overlap.

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
card_style: standalone
card_height: 110
sun_moon_x_position: -55
sun_moon_y_position: 55
sun_entity: sun.sun
tap_action:
  action: more-info
  entity: weather.forecast_home
```

> **Tip** — The location text is simply the `friendly_name` of your weather entity. To change it (e.g. to "London" or "My House"), simply rename the entity in Home Assistant. The temperature is formatted automatically based on your Home Assistant language setting (e.g. `4.5` in English, `4,5` in German).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2 — Grid Layout</b></summary>
<br>

| Grid |

You can use a taller aspect ratio to fit the card perfectly into a grid or horizontal stack alongside other cards. This example pairs the weather card with a graph and a tile card.

```yaml
type: grid
columns: 2
cards:
  - type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
    weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
    card_style: standalone
    card_height: 200
    sun_moon_x_position: -30
    sun_moon_y_position: 30
    sun_entity: sun.sun
    tap_action:
      action: more-info
      entity: weather.forecast_home
  - type: vertical-stack
    cards:
      - type: sensor
        graph: line
        entity: sensor.temperature_indoor
        detail: 1
        name: Indoor Temp
      - type: tile
        entity: sensor.climate_sensor
        name: Air Quality
        icon: mdi:leaf
        state_content: state
        vertical: false
```

</details>

Renders with a fully transparent background so it blends seamlessly into your dashboard. For this to look right, you need a Home Assistant theme that switches between a light and dark background. Without it, weather effects will float on a static background color.

<details>
<summary><b>Example 1 — Header Integration</b></summary>
<br>

| Day | Night |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d810a910-0df0-4b7d-ae0e-a6a4c739f47a" width="100%"> | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5196c877-21c6-4a63-b273-99538cdbe970" width="100%"> |

This layout gives the weather effects space to breathe. It works perfectly at the top of a dashboard.

**How to do it:** Place a Markdown card with any text *before* the Atmospheric Weather Card. Then, use the `offset` feature on the weather card to layer it *behind* the text.

```yaml
# 1. The Content Card (Foreground)
type: markdown
content: |
  <br>
  ⛅ Enjoy the weather!
  # {{states('sensor.time') }}

# 2. The Weather Card (Background Layer)
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
full_width: true
card_height: 240
# Pulls the card up 120px to sit behind the Markdown card
offset: "-120px 0px 0px 0px"
sun_moon_x_position: -100
sun_moon_y_position: 100
sun_entity: sun.sun
moon_phase_entity: sensor.moon_phase
tap_action:
  action: none
```

This setup shows how I use this card. It uses it as a dynamic backdrop for the entire top section of the view, combining it with custom images (like a house) and overlay buttons. The card provides the animated weather and house image; the buttons shown in the image are separate elements layered on top. [See Adding Buttons](#adding-buttons) and [Custom House Image](#custom-house-image) for details.

### CONFIGURATION REFERENCE

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `weather_entity` | `string` | **required** | Your weather integration entity. The only required option. |
| | | | |
| **Layout & Appearance** | | | |
| `card_style` | `string\|boolean` | `false` | Set to `standalone` to enable standalone mode with built-in backgrounds and text. Omit or set to `false` for immersive (transparent) mode. |
| `card_height` | `number\|string` | `200px` | Card height. Numbers are treated as pixels (`110` → `110px`). Strings are used as-is. |
| `full_width` | `boolean` | `false` | Stretches the card edge-to-edge by removing side margins. Mainly useful in immersive mode. |
| `offset` | `string` | `0px` | CSS margin shorthand applied to the card. Format: `"Top Right Bottom Left"`. Negative values pull the card behind adjacent elements (e.g. `"-50px 0px 0px 0px"`). |
| | | | |
| **Sun & Moon Position** | | | |
| `sun_moon_x_position` | `number` | `100` | Horizontal position. **Positive** = offset from the left edge. **Negative** = offset from the right edge (e.g. `-55` places it 55 units from the right). |
| `sun_moon_y_position` | `number` | `100` | Vertical distance from the top. |
| | | | |
| **Custom Image** | | | |
| `day` | `string` | — | Path to a daytime image (e.g. `/local/images/house-day.png`). Transparent PNGs work best. |
| `night` | `string` | — | Path to a nighttime image. Falls back to `day` if not set. |
| `image_scale` | `number` | `100` | Image height as a percentage of the card height. |
| `image_alignment` | `string` | `top-right` | Image position. Combine vertical (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) + horizontal (`left`, `right`). Examples: `bottom-right`, `center-left`, `bottom`. |
| | | | |
| **Smart Status** | | | |
| `status_entity` | `string` | — | Entity to watch (e.g. `binary_sensor.front_door`). Requires at least one status image. |
| `status_image_day` | `string` | — | Override image for daytime when entity is active. |
| `status_image_night` | `string` | — | Override image for nighttime. Falls back to `status_image_day`. |
| | | | |
| **Entities & Logic** | | | |
| `mode` | `string` | `auto` | Force day/night: `light` or `day` for daytime, `dark` or `night` for nighttime, `auto` to detect automatically. See [Day / Night Logic](#day--night-logic). |
| `sun_entity` | `string` | — | Sun entity for automatic day/night detection (e.g. `sun.sun`). |
| `theme_entity` | `string` | — | An entity whose state indicates the active theme. Night mode triggers when the state is `dark`, `night`, `evening`, `on`, `true`, or `below_horizon`. |
| `moon_phase_entity` | `string` | — | Moon phase sensor (e.g. `sensor.moon_phase`). Renders the moon with accurate illumination and terminator. Supported: `new_moon`, `waxing_crescent`, `first_quarter`, `waxing_gibbous`, `full_moon`, `waning_gibbous`, `last_quarter`, `waning_crescent`. |
| | | | |
| **Interaction** | | | |
| `tap_action` | `object` | — | Standard HA action config. Example: `{ action: more-info, entity: weather.forecast }` |

> **Tip** — The sun and moon share a single position. During the day the sun is drawn there (only in fair weather like sunny, partly cloudy, exceptional); at night the moon takes its place. In standalone mode, the text automatically moves to the opposite side.

> **Tip** — Active states for the status feature are: `on`, `open`, `unlocked`, `true`, `home`, `active`.

<br>

---

### DAY / NIGHT LOGIC

The card determines whether to render a day or night scene using a 4-level priority chain. It checks each level in order and uses the first match.

| Priority | Source | Config Option | Logic |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Manual override | `mode` | `dark`/`night` forces night. `light`/`day` forces day. |
| **2** | Theme entity | `theme_entity` | Matches the entity state against night keywords (`dark`, `night`, `evening`, `on`, `true`, `below_horizon`). |
| **3** | Sun entity | `sun_entity` | Checks if `sun.sun` is `below_horizon`. |
| **4** | System dark mode | — | Falls back to the Home Assistant dark mode toggle in the sidebar. |

> [!NOTE]
> For most setups, `sun_entity: sun.sun` is all you need. The `theme_entity` option is useful if you have a theme automation (e.g. an `input_select`) that you want the card to follow instead of the sun.

<br>

---

### CUSTOM HOUSE IMAGE

To get the immersive look with your own home:

1. **Take a reference photo** from a corner angle to capture depth.
2. **Generate a 3D model image** using an AI image tool with a prompt like:
   > Isometric view of a modern minimalist architectural model section from the outside on solid white background. [Describe your floors/rooms]. Materials are matte white and light wood only. No complex textures, studio lighting, very clean, simplified shapes.
3. **Remove the background** and save as a transparent PNG.
4. **Create day and night variants** with adjusted lighting/colors.
5. **Upload** to `config/www/images/` and reference as `/local/images/my-house-day.png`.

<br>

---

### SMART STATUS ENTITY

The status feature swaps the displayed image when an entity becomes active. Some examples:

| Use case | Example entity | Triggers on |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Door / Window | `binary_sensor.front_door` | `open` |
| Lock | `lock.front_door` | `unlocked` |
| Toggle | `input_boolean.party_mode` | `on` |
| Presence | `zone.home` | `active` |

When the entity returns to an inactive state, the card switches back to the default image.

<br>

---

### ADDING BUTTONS

The floating buttons in the dashboard screenshots are built with `custom:paper-buttons-row` placed before the weather card. Use the `offset` option on this card to layer them visually. A reference config is included in `paper-buttons-row-example.yml`.

<br>

---

### SUPPORTED WEATHER STATES

`sunny` · `clear-night` · `partlycloudy` · `cloudy` · `fog` · `rainy` · `pouring` · `snowy` · `snowy-rainy` · `hail` · `lightning` · `lightning-rainy` · `windy` · `windy-variant` · `exceptional`

Each state sets a unique combination of particle type, count, cloud density, wind speed, and atmosphere. Beyond the core weather, the sky is populated with ambient elements that appear on their own — drifting fog banks, wind-blown leaves, sun rays with heat shimmer, lightning bolts, airplanes, birds in formation, shooting stars, comets, and the rare Aurora Borealis at night. The card also reads `wind_speed` from your weather entity to influence particle behavior in real time.

<br>

---

### PERFORMANCE

The card targets 30fps with a max device pixel ratio of 2x. Animations pause automatically when the card scrolls out of view and reinitialize on resize with debouncing. The card is resizable in Section-based dashboards out of the box.
