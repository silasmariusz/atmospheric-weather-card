## Technical Features

* **Animated Ambient Environment:** Includes wind-blown leaves, drifting fog banks, randomized lightning bolts, and sun rays with heat shimmer. The sky stays busy with airplanes, birds in various formations, shooting stars, comets, and the rare Aurora Borealis.
* **Organic Cloud Generation:** Uses a custom generator to create unique, realistic cloud shapes every time, ensuring your sky never looks repetitive.
* **Dynamic Weather Physics:** Individual particles for rain, snow, and hail with custom physics for speed, turbulence, and wobbling.
* **Real-Time Moon Rendering:** Calculates and draws the exact moon illumination and terminator line based on your sensor data.
* **Supports using your own custom image:** Personalize the card by displaying your own image on the right side. It’s perfect for a transparent PNG of your home, boat, or wherever your Home Assistant is running.
* **Performance & Battery Optimized:** Automatically pauses animations when the card is hidden from view and uses debounced resizing to prevent dashboard lag.

## Configuration

### Basic Usage
The only strict requirement is a weather entity.

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
```

### Full Configuration (Recommended)
To get the full effect with your own home image, smart status, and moon phases:

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home

# --- Logic & Automation ---
# Optional: Force "light" or "dark" mode manually (Priority 1)
mode: auto
# Optional: For theme-based automatic toggling (Priority 2)
theme_entity: input_select.theme
# Optional: For automatic day/night detection (Priority 3)
sun_entity: sun.sun
# Optional: For accurate moon phases
moon_phase_entity: sensor.moon_phase

# --- Layout --- 
# Optional: Detects dashboard margins and expands to use full width
full_width: true
# Optional: Move the card via margins to overlap other elements (supports negative values)
offset: "-50px 0px 0px 0px"
# Optional: Move Sun/Moon position (90 = default). 
# Positive = Distance from Left. Negative (-90) = Distance from Right.
sun_moon_x_position: -50
# Optional: Vertical distance from top (90 = default)
sun_moon_y_position: 40 

# --- Images ---
# Optional: Your custom images (transparent PNGs recommended)
day: /local/images/my-house-day.png
night: /local/images/my-house-night.png

# --- Smart Status (Optional) ---
# Changes the house image when this entity is active (e.g. on, open, unlocked, home)
status_entity: binary_sensor.front_door
status_image_day: /local/images/house-open-day.png
status_image_night: /local/images/house-open-night.png
```

## Feature Documentation

### Smart Day/Night Logic
The card uses a strict 3-layer priority system to decide if it should render Night (moon and stars, darker clouds) or Day (sun, lighter clouds) effects. This ensures your weather effects always match the background.

| Priority | Name | Config Option | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Manual Mode** | `mode` | If set to `light` or `dark`, it overrides **everything**. Perfect for fixed themes. |
| **2** | **Theme Entity** | `theme_entity` | If the entity state is "Dark" or "Night", night visuals are applied. |
| **3** | **Automation** | `sun_entity` | Fallback. Checks if sun is `below_horizon`. |

### Celestial Positioning
You can precisely control where the Sun and Moon appear.
* **`sun_moon_x_position`**: Controls horizontal placement.
    * **Positive (e.g., `90`)**: Measures pixels from the **Left**.
    * **Negative (e.g., `-90`)**: Measures pixels from the **Right**.
* **`sun_moon_y_position`**: Measures pixels from the **Top**.

### Generic Status Entity
You can override the default house image based on **any** entity's state using `status_entity`.

* **Trigger:** The image changes if the entity is in any active state: `on`, `open`, `unlocked`, `true`, `home`, `active`.

**Use Case Examples:**

| Category | Example Entity | Active State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Door/Window** | `binary_sensor.front_door` | `open` |
| **Locks** | `lock.front_door` | `unlocked` |
| **Modes** | `input_boolean.party_mode` | `on` |
| **Presence** | `zone.home` | `active` |

### Layout Offset
You can control the exact positioning of the card using the `offset` option. This applies standard CSS margins to the card container.

* **Syntax:** `"Top Right Bottom Left"` (e.g., `"-50px 0px 0px 0px"`).
* **Purpose:** Use negative values to pull the weather card *behind* other dashboard cards, allowing for seamless layering effects.

## Custom House Image Generation

You can create a personalized 3D-style image for this card using AI image generators.

**1. Capture a Reference:** Take a clear photo of your house or the specific area you want to display. Aim for a wide shot that shows the overall layout. Taking the photo from a corner usually helps the AI understand the perspective and depth better.

**2. Generate the Image:** Use a prompt that focuses on a "clean model" aesthetic. You can use the template below, adjusting the description to match your specific home layout.

**Prompt Template:**
> Isometric view of a modern minimalist architectural model section from the outside on solid white background. [Describe your specific floors or rooms here]. Materials are matte white and light wood only. No complex textures, studio lighting, very clean, simplified shapes.

**3. Remove the Background:** The card requires a transparent PNG so that clouds and stars are visible behind the house. Use a free tool like remove.bg or Photoshop to remove the background from your generated image. 

## Adding Buttons
To achieve the exact look in the screenshots (where buttons and weather data "float" over the weather visuals), you can add a `custom:paper-buttons-row` card **before** this weather card.

There's a simplified card example in the repository which mimics the style in the screenshots. You can use the `offset` feature to achieve the overlay effect.
