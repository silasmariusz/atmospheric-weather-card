> **Info about the screenshots:** These images show a "finished" dashboard example. This card provides the **animated weather background and house image only**. The buttons you see floating on top are *not included*—they are separate cards (e.g., `paper-buttons-row`) that I placed over the weather card.

## Technical Features
* **Triple-Layer Canvas Engine:** Uses dedicated background, middle, and foreground layers to create a sense of depth between weather effects and your home image.
* **Organic Cloud Generation:** Uses a custom generator to create unique, non-repeating cloud shapes including cumulus, stratus, and cirrus varieties.
* **Smart Logic System:** Intelligent hierarchy determines Day/Night state (Theme > Sun > System) and handles status overrides for any entity type.
* **Dynamic Weather Physics:** Individual particles for rain, snow, and hail with custom physics for speed, turbulence, and wobbling.
* **Ambient Environment:** Includes wind-blown leaves, drifting fog banks, randomized lightning bolts, airplanes, shooting stars and rare aurora borealis effects.
* **Real-Time Moon Rendering:** Calculates and draws the exact moon illumination and terminator line based on your sensor data.
* **Performance Optimized:** Automatically pauses animations when the card is hidden from view and uses debounced resizing to prevent dashboard lag.

## Performance
This card is optimized to run smoothly on standard tablets and wall panels. Because HTML Canvas animations can be demanding on hardware, the visual effects and frame rate are intentionally toned down to prevent your Home Assistant dashboard from lagging or becoming unresponsive.

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)
1.  Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2.  Go to **Frontend** > **Custom repositories** (via the top-right menu).
3.  Add this repository URL and select the category **Dashboard**.
4.  Click **Install**.
5.  When prompted, accept the option to reload the dashboard.

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1.  Download the `atmospheric-weather-card.js` file from the latest release.
2.  Upload the file to your Home Assistant `config/www/` folder.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Dashboards** > **Three Dots Icon** > **Resources**.
4.  Click **Add Resource**:
    * **URL:** `/local/atmospheric-weather-card.js`
    * **Resource Type:** JavaScript Module
5.  Refresh your browser (clear cache) to load the card.

## Configuration

### Basic Usage
The only strict requirement is a weather entity.

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card-opt
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home
```

### Full Configuration (Recommended)
To get the full effect with your own home image, smart status, and moon phases:

```yaml
type: custom:atmospheric-weather-card-opt
weather_entity: weather.forecast_home

# --- Layout ---
# Optional: Detects dashboard margins and expands to use full width
full_width: true
# Optional: Move the card via margins to overlap other elements (supports negative values)
offset: "-50px 0px 0px 0px"

# --- Logic & Automation ---
# Optional: Manual Dark/Light Mode Toggle (Priority 1)
theme_entity: input_select.theme
# Optional: For automatic day/night detection (Priority 2)
sun_entity: sun.sun
# Optional: For accurate moon phases on clear nights
moon_phase_entity: sensor.moon_phase

# --- Images ---
# Optional: Your custom images (transparent PNGs recommended)
day: /local/images/my-house-day.png
night: /local/images/my-house-night.png

# --- Smart Status (Optional) ---
# Changes the house image when this entity is active (e.g. on, open, unlocked, home)
status_entity: binary_sensor.front_door
status_image_day: /local/images/house-open-day.png
status_image_night: /local/images/house-open-night.png
```

## Feature Documentation

### Smart Day/Night Logic
The card uses a 3-layer priority system to decide if it should render Night (stars) or Day (blue sky) effects:
1.  **Priority 1 (Manual):** `theme_entity`. If this is set to "Dark" or "Night", it overrides everything else.
2.  **Priority 2 (Automation):** `sun_entity`. If defined (e.g., `sun.sun`), the card checks if the sun is `below_horizon`.
3.  **Priority 3 (System):** If neither is defined, it checks if your Home Assistant / Browser is in Dark Mode.

### Generic Status Entity
You can override the default house image based on **any** entity's state using `status_entity`.
* **Replaces the old "Door" config:** This is a more flexible version of the previous door sensor logic.
* **Triggers:** The image changes if the entity is in any active state: `on`, `open`, `unlocked`, `true`, `home`, `active`.
* **Use Cases:**
    * **Door/Window:** `binary_sensor.front_door` (State: open)
    * **Locks:** `lock.front_door` (State: unlocked)
    * **Modes:** `input_boolean.party_mode` (State: on)
    * **Presence:** `zone.home` (State: active)

### Layout Offset
You can control the exact positioning of the card using the `offset` option. This applies standard CSS margins to the card container.
* **Syntax:** `"Top Right Bottom Left"` (e.g., `"-50px 0px 0px 0px"`).
* **Purpose:** Use negative values to pull the weather card *behind* other dashboard cards, allowing for seamless layering effects.

## Custom House Image Generation

You can create a personalized 3D-style image for this card using AI image generators (like Midjourney or DALL-E 3) without needing 3D modeling skills.

**1. Capture a Reference:** Take a clear photo of your house or the specific area you want to display. Aim for a wide shot that shows the overall layout. Taking the photo from a corner usually helps the AI understand the perspective and depth better.

**2. Generate the Image:** Use a prompt that focuses on a "clean model" aesthetic. You can use the template below, adjusting the description to match your specific home layout.

**Prompt Template:**
Isometric view of a modern minimalist architectural model section from the outside. [Describe your specific floors or rooms here]. Materials are matte white and light wood only. No complex textures, studio lighting, very clean, simplified shapes.


### Adding Buttons
To achieve the exact look in the screenshots (where buttons and weather data "float" over the weather visuals), you can add a `custom:paper-buttons-row` card **before** this weather card. 

I have added a simplified card example to the repository which mimics the style in the screenshots. You can use the `offset` feature to achieve the overlay effect.

## Troubleshooting
* **Card is blank?** Make sure you have refreshed your browser cache.
* **Visuals look pixelated?** This is intentional for performance. I want to focus on stability first and increase the visuals gradually.
* **Dark Mode:** This card looks best when your dashboard theme is set to **Dark Mode**, as the particle effects (stars, rain) stand out better.
